"""
The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by,
tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to
its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value.
For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10.
If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the
word a triangle word.
Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),
a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words,
how many are triangle words?
